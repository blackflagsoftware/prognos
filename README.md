# Prognos
### Forcast (Swedish)

This tutorial project is for the youtube channel `The Dev Banner`.

Prognos is application will help you keep track of your budget.  This project is written in Golang.

The project will be divided into branch per episode.  With the exception of the first episode, each episode will have two versions of the project (the `N` is the episode number):

- epN-todo
- epN-done

The goal with having two version of each episode will give the student the ability to work from, to do the `homework` from the video, this will be found in epN-todo.  The epN-done is my final work for the episode, so the next episode will start with former epN-done's code in place.

### Instruction
If you don't know git very well, follow these:

Make a folder in your `$GOPATH/src` directory: `github.com/blackflagsoftware`, in the `blackflagsoftware` directory you would do this command: `git clone git@github.com:blackflagsoftware/prognos.git`, then run this command: `git branch` to see all the branches.  To switch branches: `git checkout epN-todo`.

### Your project, your version
I would recommend that this particular repo is not the one you work on.  Meaning I would start the tutorial project in your own directory (in the `$GOPATH/src` directory) and use that to do your homework.  Using this project and directory as reference and to copy/paste from as needed.  Hopefully you will type out everything as we go along, I call it practice!
